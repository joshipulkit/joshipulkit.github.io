## Fast checks

- Look for near-degenerate manifolds within 0.1–0.2 eV.
- Evaluate orbital angular momentum indicators on frontier states.
- Use small-basis TDDFT to rank transitions before higher-level EOM runs.

If strong coupling is likely, add one higher angular momentum shell to the active space and re-evaluate.
